  A blog to learn R tricks with sports examples!
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

I created this blog as a way to save examples of how to perform various R tasks.  All the examples in this blog will be sports related because that is the way I stay interested and learn.  I hope you can find the examples helpful!
